Your learning today is correct, and youâ€™ve captured the key concepts well! Here's a quick recap and validation of your points:

# React Router is an Add-on: Yes, React Router is not part of the core React library; it's a separate library used for handling routing in React applications.

# Using <Link> and <NavLink> Instead of <a>: Correct! Using <a> tags would reload the page, which contradicts React's approach of maintaining a single-page application (SPA). The <Link> and <NavLink> components allow for navigation without page reloads, and <NavLink> indeed has extra features like the isActive callback, which you used to manage the styles of active links.

# Using Outlet for Rendering Content: You are absolutely right! The Outlet component is used to render nested routes within a parent component, which is essential for keeping the layout (header/footer) static while changing the content in between.

# Using RouterProvider and CreateBrowserRouter(): This is correct as well! The RouterProvider is used to provide the routing context to your application, and CreateBrowserRouter() helps you define the routes.
